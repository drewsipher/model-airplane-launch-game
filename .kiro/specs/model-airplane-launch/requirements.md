# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Model Airplane Launch game is a 3D physics-based simulation where players design, build, and launch model airplanes using an elastic band launcher. The core gameplay revolves around maximizing flight distance through strategic plane construction and upgrades. Players earn money based on flight performance, which can be invested in better parts and components. The physics system ensures that aerodynamic design choices directly impact flight behavior, creating a realistic and engaging building experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to launch my model airplane using an elastic band mechanism, so that I can test my plane's flight performance and earn rewards based on distance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player pulls back on the elastic band THEN the system SHALL display visual feedback showing the tension and potential launch power
2. WHEN the player releases the elastic band THEN the airplane SHALL launch with physics-accurate force based on the tension applied
3. WHEN the airplane lands or crashes THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the total flight distance
4. WHEN a flight is completed THEN the player SHALL earn money proportional to the distance achieved

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to build and customize my airplane from individual parts, so that I can experiment with different designs and optimize flight performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player enters the building mode THEN the system SHALL provide a 3D workspace with available airplane parts
2. WHEN the player selects a part THEN the system SHALL allow placement and positioning of that part on the airplane frame
3. WHEN parts are attached asymmetrically THEN the building workspace system SHALL show the center of balance, and center of lift
4. WHEN parts are attached asymmetrically THEN the physics system SHALL reflect the imbalanced weight distribution in flight behavior
5. WHEN the player creates an aerodynamically unsound design THEN the airplane SHALL exhibit realistic flight problems like tumbling or spinning
6. IF the airplane has lopsided wings THEN the system SHALL cause the plane to tumble during flight

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to purchase upgrades and new parts with earned money, so that I can improve my airplane's performance and unlock new design possibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player accesses the shop THEN the system SHALL display available parts with their costs and performance characteristics
2. WHEN the player has sufficient funds THEN the system SHALL allow purchase of new parts or upgrades
3. WHEN a part is purchased THEN it SHALL become unlocked and available in the building mode inventory
4. WHEN the player buys upgraded parts THEN they SHALL provide measurable improvements to flight performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want realistic physics simulation for my airplane, so that my design choices have meaningful consequences on flight behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the airplane is in flight THEN the physics system SHALL calculate lift, drag, and weight distribution in real-time
2. WHEN the airplane has uneven weight distribution THEN it SHALL exhibit corresponding flight instabilities
3. WHEN environmental factors like wind are present THEN they SHALL affect the airplane's trajectory realistically
4. WHEN the airplane stalls or loses lift THEN it SHALL behave according to real aerodynamic principles

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my flight statistics and progress, so that I can track my improvement and set goals for better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a flight is completed THEN the system SHALL record the distance, flight time, and money earned
2. WHEN the player accesses the statistics screen THEN the system SHALL display historical flight data and personal records
3. WHEN the player achieves a new distance record THEN the system SHALL highlight and celebrate the achievement
4. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the player SHALL see their total money earned and spent on upgrades

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want intuitive 3D controls for building and launching, so that I can focus on the creative and strategic aspects of the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the airplane THEN the player SHALL be able to rotate the camera around the workspace smoothly
2. WHEN placing parts THEN the system SHALL provide snap-to-grid or magnetic attachment points for precise positioning
3. WHEN launching THEN the elastic band control SHALL be responsive and provide clear visual feedback
4. WHEN in flight THEN the camera SHALL follow the airplane with smooth tracking that doesn't obstruct the view

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to purchase upgrades for the launch pad and cable, so that I can improve the distance my airplane can fly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player accesses the shop THEN the system SHALL display incremental upgrades to the launch system
2. WHEN the player purchases launchpad upgrades THEN the system SHALL show the upgraded launch pad
3. WHEN the player purchases launchpad upgrades THEN the system SHALL decrease the friction or increase the force applied to the airplane on the next launch
